Module 14 Challenge

The dashboard can be deployed at: https://koskadelli.github.io/belly-button-challenge/

# Premise
In this assignment, I have built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset (http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

This assingnment utilizes the D3 library to read in json data (https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json), and manipulates an HTML page using javascript to dynamically update the dashboard, letting the user select a particpant ID to display their corresponding data.
